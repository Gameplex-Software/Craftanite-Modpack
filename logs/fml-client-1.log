	Chisel: Errors like "[FML]: Unable to lookup ..." are NOT the cause of this crash. You can safely ignore these errors. And update forge while you're at it.
	EnderIO: Found the following problem(s) with your installation:
                  * An unknown AE2 API is installed (rv3 from appliedenergistics2-rv3-beta-6.jar).
                    Ender IO was build against API version rv2 and may or may not work with a newer version.
                  * The RF API that is being used (1.7.10R1.3.1 from <unknown>) differes from that that is reported as being loaded (1.7.10R1.0.2 from FloodLights-1.7.10-1.2.8-137.jar).
                    It is a supported version, but that difference may lead to problems.
                 This may have caused the error. Try reproducing the crash WITHOUT this/these mod(s) before reporting it.
